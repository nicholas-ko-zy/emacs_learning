* Learning Emacs

This repository contains my `init.el` or emacs initialisation file. It controls my preferences for how my Emacs is set up. I intend to use this repo to store my init file in case my macachie breaks or I want to set up Emacs on another PC.

I would like to thank [Professor Olivier Danvy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Danvy) for introducing me to Emacs.
